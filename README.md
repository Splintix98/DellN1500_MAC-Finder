# DellN1500_MAC-Finder
Script that connects with a bunch of Dell N1500 Series networking switches via SSH to find the port a device with a previously specified MAC address is connected to.

The script uses python as I wasn't able to get the automated SSH access to work in a powershell script using Kitty or PoshSSH.

I have created an executable using PyInstaller which I would strongly recommend. You'll get a single executable that you can use on any system, regardless of whether it has python or the imported libraries installed as PyInstaller bundles everything up. 
That executable will then launch a console window where you can comfortably enter the password and the MAC that you're searching for.

How To create executable using PyInstaller:
    pip install pyinstaller
	cd path\to\your\script
	pyinstaller --onefile your_script.py
	anschlie√üend findet man die generierte .exe unter \path\to\your\script\dist\your_script.exe
