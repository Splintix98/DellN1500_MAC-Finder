# Added option to also output the port configuration for the found port which includes VLANs

############ TODO ############
#
# - add the functionality to enter multiple MAC addresses simultaneously to let the script search the switches for those all at once
#     - output a summary after the search has finished
#
##############################



# This function is not really in use, it was just a test to get very long outputs to work
# The dell switches truncate output as soon as it gets too long and then you'll have to press enter (possibly multiple times)
#   to get all of the output.
# This function implements this enter-pressing exemplary using the "show mac address-table"-command which results in a very long
#   output showing all mac-addresses known to the switch from the complete network.
# While collecting the output, a loading indicator is being shown to the user.
